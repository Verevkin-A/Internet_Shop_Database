- somethin wrong with auto generated primary keys? dont know yet what exactly, but will think about it
- generalization
- payment info can be null? if null, state it every time you buying something
- add comments

- phone number: maybe some validations, at least positive number (> 0)
- add normal invoice values on insertion
- ALEKSANDR check regex

# For removing sequences folder:
